<h1>SolveChain - my experiment for judging programming exercises</h1>
<h2>How will it work? Basics</h2>
<h3>The SolveChain will be smart contract on Solana blockchain</h3>
<h3>You will be rewarded of solving programming exercises in native SLV token</h3>
<h3>On input of the SolveChain you have to provide SOL worth 2$ or SLV worth 1.5$, info on what exercise are you doing and .cpp or .py file</h3>
<h3>It should be provided by normal submission window on platform supporting SolveChain</h3>
<h3>On output you will get judged between 0 and 100 points</h3>
<h3>If you will get ≥85 points, you will get (points+20)% of 2$ in SLV</h3>
<h3>If you will get ≤84 points, you will get points% of 1.5$ in SLV</h3>
